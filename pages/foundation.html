        <h2>A letter from Tim’s parents</h2>
        <h3>Dear All,</h3>
        <p>Tim’s tragic death has deeply affected many people throughout the world. He had only just begun his journey
            to know and be part of the wider world outside of music.</p>
        <p>Tim was a seeker and a sensitive, shy person who wanted to know the truth, he was interested in the human
            psyche and to find ways to an inner calm and he reacted to the world's injustices and cared deeply for the
            planet.</p>
        <p>Yet, it was in his music that he expressed himself, honestly and openly and it was the thing that gave him
            the most joy… the creative process and collaborations with the people he respected for their art and talent
            made him burst with enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>In light of our loss, a loss that is indescribable as parents, but also for Tim’s friends, colleagues in the
            music industry and millions of Tim’s fans over the world, we felt that we should do something to ensure that
            Tim’s legacy is used to help, everlasting and in ways that hopefully can make real difference in some
            important areas.</p>
        <p>With that all in mind Anki and I decided to start and devote ourselves to The Tim Bergling Foundation, which
            is the best we can do to honour our son.</p>
        <p>With love, <br>Klas Bergling & Anki Lidén</p>
