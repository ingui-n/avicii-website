        <h2>Who was Avicii?</h2>
        <p>Tim Bergling, better known by his stage name, “Avicii,” was a Swedish musician, DJ, remix artist, and
            record producer. Born and raised in Stockholm, he was one of the most popular musicians of his time.
            He
            showcased his music skills online to receive exposure. Avicii started making music at the age of 16
            and
            began posting his singles on various online music forums. Soon, he caught the attention of a music
            label. In 2011, he achieved nationwide fame with his single ‘Levels.’ Two years later, he released
            his
            debut album, ‘True.’ His music touched a new level of experimentation, as he mixed electronic music
            with
            several genres of popular music and led the album to become a major commercial and critical success.
            The
            album made its way among the top 10 hits in more than 15 countries around the world, such as Sweden,
            US,
            and Australia. For the next few years, he toured around the globe, amassing a large fan following,
            and
            became one of the most popular DJs of this generation. However, Avicii suffered from serious
            mental-health issues and committed suicide on April 20, 2018.</p>

        <h2>Childhood & Early Life</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Avicii was born Tim Bergling, on September 8, 1989, in Stockholm, Sweden, to Klas Bergling and
                Anki
                Lidén. His mother was a small-time actor who had appeared in more than 50 Swedish films and TV
                series. He was one of the four children of his parents and was heavily influenced by his older
                brother, who also happened to be a musician and DJ.
            </li>
            <li>Avicii started making music at the age of 16. Within a few months, he started posting his music
                on
                various online electronic music forums. He remixed a number of classic songs in his early years.
                His
                work reached the right people, and he soon started getting approached by well-known music
                labels.
                His music resembled that of the popular group ‘Swedish House Mafia,’ and that helped him earn a
                huge
                fan following.
            </li>
            <li>Avicii was also inspired by the music of Daft Punk and Steve Angello. He blended deep bass house
                sounds with melodic sounds. His music was appreciated by DJ Tiësto and Pete Tong. Tiësto
                introduced
                Avicii to a number of professional DJs and also set up live shows for him, at small venues.
            </li>
            <li>By 2010, Avicii had started working as a small-time DJ, remixing for artists such as Little
                Boots
                and Robyn. Meanwhile, he continued to release his own singles, such as ‘Bromance’ and ‘My
                Feelings
                for You.’ ‘Seek Bromance,’ the remixed version of his single ‘Bromance,’ with vocals by Amanda
                Wilson, was a huge success.

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>His initial successes got Avicii acquainted with the right people in the music industry. By 2011, he had
                already finished working on his breakthrough single, ‘Levels.’ The song included vocals from the famous
                gospel-inspired 60s song ‘Something’s got a Hold on Me’ by Etta James. ‘Levels’ made waves nationally
                and internationally and established Avicii in the mainstream music arena. The song made its place among
                the top 10 hits of many European countries and also made waves across the US.
            </li>
            <li>Riding high on the success of ‘Levels,’ Avicii received the surprise of his life when he was approached
                by superstar DJ David Guetta, who suggested a collaborative track.
            </li>
            <li>The collaboration resulted in the single ‘Sunshine,’ which became an instant international success. It
                was later nominated for the ‘Grammy’ award for the ‘Best Dance Recording.’
            </li>
            <li>The same year, he also faced a slight controversy. A portion of his single ‘Fade into Darkness’ was
                allegedly used without his permission by Leona Lewis, on her single ‘Collide.’ Leona did not credit
                Avicii, and the entire matter went to court. Subsequently, Leona’s lawyer offered Avicii a collaborative
                album with his client. Avicii accepted the offer, and the matter was resolved.
            </li>
            <li>At the 2012 ‘Ultra Music Festival’ in Miami, Avicii released his new track, ‘Girl Gone Wild’ with
                Madonna. At the same event, he released another single, ‘Superlove’ with Lenny Kravitz. The same year,
                he gained two million likes on his ‘Facebook’ page. Following this, he released a track titled ‘Two
                Million’ and made it free for download on the music-streaming platform ‘SoundCloud.’
            </li>
            <li>Over the next few months, he released some more successful singles, such as ‘Silhouettes,’ ‘Dancing in
                my Head,’ ‘Stay with You,’ and ‘Let it Go.’ The last two songs were from his debut studio album, which
                he announced he would release in 2013. Meanwhile, his success streak continued in 2012, with several new
                collaborations. He collaborated with Nicky Romero for the single ‘I Could Be the One,’ which became a
                major hit with the American audiences. The song was featured on several American reality shows and
                European radio shows.
            </li>
            <li>In early 2013, Avicii released ‘Wake Me Up,’ one of his most meaningful and most successful singles to
                date. The song topped the charts in more than 20 countries across the world and is known as his most
                successful single. In mid-2013, he announced in an interview that his debut studio album, ‘True,’ would
                be available for sale by the end of that year. He also gave a glimpse into the album by saying that he
                had heavily used the new genre “folktronica,” a blend of folk music and electronic music.
            </li>
            <li>‘Wake Me Up’ became the fastest-selling single in the UK by the end of July. The single also made a
                record for staying on the top of ‘Billboard’s ‘Dance/Electronic’ music chart for 14 weeks. Avicii
                released more singles from the album in the following months, only increasing the curiosity about his
                album.
            </li>
            <li>The album ‘True’ was released in late 2013 and featured several established artists, such as Nile
                Rodgers and Adam Lambert. A few more songs from the album, such as ‘Hey Brother’ and ‘Addicted to You,’
                became successful, and the album was certified “platinum” by the ‘Recording Industry Association of
                America’ (RIAA). The following year, Avicii released the club remix version of the album, ‘True: Avicii
                by Avicii.’ The same year, he collaborated with Chris Martin from the legendary rock band ‘Coldplay,’
                for the single ‘A Sky Full of Stars.’
            </li>
            <li>In late 2015, Avicii released his second album, ‘Stories,’ and merged pop music with electronic sounds.
                The album reached the top of the ‘Billboard’ dance chart. Some of his other successful singles from this
                period were a remix of Nina Simone’s classic jazz song ‘Feeling Good,’ ‘Tracks of my Tears,’ ‘Divine
                Sorrow,’ and ‘Heaven.’
            </li>
            <li>Due to frequent live tours, he became exhausted. In 2016, he announced that he would be retiring from
                live shows. His last live performance was in Ibiza.
            </li>

        <h2>Personal Life & Death</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Avicii was known to be a heavy alcoholic, and the habit had impacted his health. In 2012, he was
                diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and had his gall bladder and appendix removed. Despite the health
                concerns, he kept touring continuously and risked his mental and physical well-being.
            </li>
            <li>By 2017, he started talking about depression and suicidal thoughts openly. Depression is highly
                prevalent in artists, and Avicii became one of its latest victims. The pressure and the lack of privacy
                that fame brought, perhaps, contributed to his failing mental health.
            </li>
            <li>On April 20, 2018, his lifeless body was found in his hotel room near Muscat, Oman. A few days later,
                his family revealed that he had cut himself and bled to death. With Avicii’s suicide, another bright
                star of the music industry dimmed forever. The concept of the “tortured artist” had once again made its
                presence felt. He was 28 years old at the time of his death, but his music shall always remain ageless
                and immortal.
