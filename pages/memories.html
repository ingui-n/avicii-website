My biggest dream was to go to one of your show, sadly it's gonna stay a dream... I hope from where you are you can feel all the love we're sending to you. And it's with a lump in the throat that I'm gonna keep listening to your music in all the upcoming moments that life has to offer. RIP...</p>

When I started my radio career, his music career had just started to lift off so you'll always be in my thoughts. Your music takes me back to the time i started all this and it reminds me of how i felt at that time which fuels my passion even more. My condolences to your family, friends and all whom were directly or indirectly inspired by your music. RIP Tim!</p>

            <p class="memory__message">Thank you to the family for allowing us to hear the final amazing music made by Tim. Avicii was Avicii, but Tim was Tim. I wish I was able to help him through the hard times he had. I am an introverted person like Tim was and the pressure that comes with fame is not for everyone. I have a hard time with society as a "normal" person, never mind the position in fame. I would not be able to do it. Tim, I hope you rest easy now. Miss you everyday, but your legacy and music will forever be with me.</p>

I saw my best friends and my girlfriend that I loved since I was 10, leaving me alone. I never had goods relationships with my family too, and trust me I'm very sociable. But when I heard you, listened to "the nights" or "Trouble", I decided to only trust into you and music's. So thank you to be a part of me ‚ô•Ô∏è</p>

Tim was the true master of EDF and without his music the world wouldn't be the same. There is no one else that is as talented as he was. His music helped me through a lot good and bad times in my life and will keep listening always. Thank you for realising the album Tim</p>
